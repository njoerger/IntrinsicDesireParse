IntrinsicDesireParse
====================

Used to read in a csv file that will then be interpreted into the test cases results for Dr. Reiss intrinsic motivation test (this one does not include results for romance due to scope of use but most of the needed code is present witin the files).  To compile and use must have access to Boost 1.53.0 on the compiling machine (only need the header packages) and access to a c++11 compile.
