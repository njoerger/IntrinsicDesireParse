IntrinsicDesireParse
====================

Writtn to interpret the results of Dr. Reiss Intrinsic Motivation test. This suite also includes a mostly generic csv reader as well which as use in other programs.  This is not a complete implementation due to my personal scope of this test.  I have not totally included romance. Parts of it have been written and would need to be uncommented and recompiled.  If there is the desire or need I can finish implementation or someone can fork and can ask for a pull request.

To compile and use must have access to Boost 1.53.0 on the compiling machine (only need the header packages) and access to a c++11 compiler.

Future Features
====================

generic super/sub type for "sort by"
fix memory leaks
